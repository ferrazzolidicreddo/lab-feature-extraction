    "Instructions\n",
    "*    Import the necessary libraries if you are starting a new notebook.\n",
    "*    Load the continuous and discrete variables into continuous_df and discrete_df variables.\n",
    "*    Plot a correlation matrix, what can you see?\n",
    "*    Create a function to plot every discrete variables. Do the same with continuous variables (be careful, you may change the plot type to another one better suited for continuous data).\n",
    "*    What can you see in the plots?\n",
    "*    Look for outliers in the continuous variables we have found. Hint: There was a good plot to do that.\n",
    "*    Have you found outliers? If you have, what should we do with them?\n",
    "*    Check nan values per column.\n",
    "*    Define a function that differentiate between continuous and discrete variables. Hint: Number of unique values might be useful. Store continuous data into a continuous variable and do the same for discrete and categorical.\n",
    "*    for the categorical data, check if there is some kind of text in a variable so we would need to clean it. Hint: Use the same method you used in step 7. Depending on the implementation, decide what to do with the variables you get.\n",
    "*    Get categorical features.\n",
    "*    What should we do with the customer id column?"
